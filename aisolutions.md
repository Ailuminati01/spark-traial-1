# Stamp and Signature Detection Solution

## 1. Project Overview
### Use Case Title:
Stamp and Signature Detection and Validation for Official Documents

### Team Name:
S.P.A.R.K. (Secure Police Archival & Record Keeper)

### Team Members & Roles:
- Document Processing Specialist
- AI/ML Engineer
- Security & Validation Expert
- UI/UX Designer
- Backend Developer

### Problem Statement:
The Andhra Pradesh Police Department needs a reliable system to detect and validate official stamps and signatures on scanned documents. Manual verification is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to potential security risks and processing delays. The system must accurately identify physical ink stamps and handwritten signatures while distinguishing them from printed text or digital elements.

### Solution Summary:
Our solution implements an AI-powered stamp and signature detection system that analyzes scanned documents to identify, extract, and validate official stamps and signatures. The system uses computer vision techniques to detect physical ink stamps and handwritten signatures, validates stamps against a master list of authorized stamps, and provides a comprehensive validation report. This significantly reduces document processing time, improves security, and ensures document authenticity.

## 3. Architecture Diagram & Data Flow
### 3.1. System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture with local processing capabilities:

- **Frontend Layer**: React application with TailwindCSS for UI components
- **Processing Layer**: Document analysis using Azure AI and local TensorFlow.js models
- **Storage Layer**: Dual storage with IndexedDB (local) and Supabase (cloud)
- **Security Layer**: CryptoJS for client-side encryption, Supabase RLS for data access control

### 3.2. Data Flow
1. User uploads document through the UI
2. Document is processed locally using TensorFlow.js for initial analysis
3. Azure AI Document Intelligence extracts text and identifies document regions
4. Stamp detection algorithm identifies potential stamps based on shape, color, and position
5. Signature detection identifies handwritten marks using stroke analysis
6. Detected stamps are validated against master list using pattern matching
7. Results are displayed to user with visual indicators
8. Document metadata and validation results are stored in local IndexedDB
9. Data is synced to Supabase when connection is available
